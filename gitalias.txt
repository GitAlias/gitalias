[alias]

  ##
  # One letter alias for our most frequent commands.
  #
  # Guidelines: these aliases do not use options, because we want
  # these aliases to be easy to compose and use in many ways.
  ##

  a = add
  b = branch
  c = commit
  d = diff
  f = fetch
  g = grep
  l = log
  m = merge
  o = checkout
  p = pull
  r = remote
  s = status
  w = whatchanged

  ##
  # Short aliases for our frequent commands.
  #
  # Guidelines:
  #
  #  * Generally speaking, the alias should be in the same
  #    order as the command name followed by its options.
  #
  #    * Right: fb = foo --bar
  #    * Wrong: bf = foo --bar
  #
  #  * To write offets, use a "~" tilde character, not a "^" carat character.
  #    This is because "^" is a continuation character in DOS so won't work.
  ##

  ### add ###

  # add all
  aa = add --all

  # add by patch - looks at each change, and asks if we want to put it in the repo.
  ap = add --patch

  # add just the files that are updated.
  au = add --update

  ### branch ###

  # branch - edit the description
  be = branch --edit-description

  # branch and only list branches whose tips are reachable from the specified commit (HEAD if not specified).
  bm = branch --merged

  # branch and only list branches whose tips are not reachable from the specified commit (HEAD if not specified).
  bnm = branch --no-merged

  ### commit ###

  # commit - amend the tip of the current branch rather than creating a new commit.
  ca = commit --amend

  # commit interactive
  ci = commit --interactive

  # commit with a message
  cm = commit --message

  ### checkout ###

  # checkout - update the working tree to match a branch or paths. [same as "o" for "out"]
  co = checkout

  ### cherry-pick ###

  # cherry-pick - apply the changes introduced by some existing commits; useful for moving small chunks of code between branches.
  cp = cherry-pick

  # cherry-pick without making a commit, and when when recording the commit, append a line that says "(cherry picked from commit ...)"
  cp-nx = cherry-pick --no-commit -x

  ### diff ###

  # diff - show changes not yet staged
  dc = diff --cached

  # diff - changes about to be commited
  ds = diff --staged

  # diff - show changes but by word, not line
  dw = diff --word-diff

  ### grep ###

  # grep with grouping of the output lines
  gg =  grep --break --heading --line-number

  ### log ###

  # log with a text-based graphical representation of the commit history.
  lg = log --graph

  # log with one line per item.
  lo = log --oneline

  # log with patch generation.
  lp = log --patch

  # log with items appearing in topological order, i.e. descendant commits are shown before their parents.
  lt = log --topo-order

  # log key - our favorite way to show our key performance indicators, i.e. our most useful summary.
  lk = log --graph --topo-order --abbrev-commit --date=short --decorate --all --boundary --pretty=format:'%Cgreen%ad %Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cblue[%cn]%Creset'

  ## ls-files ##

  # ls-files - show information about files in the index and the working tree; like Unix "ls" command.
  ls = ls-files

  # ls-ignored -  list files that git has ignored.
  ls-ignored = ls-files --others --i --exclude-standard

  ### merge ###

  # merge but without autocommit, and with a commit even if the merge resolved as a fast-forward.
  me = merge --no-commit --no-ff

  ### pull ###

  # pull if a merge can be resolved as a fast-forward, otherwise fail.
  pf = pull --ff-only

  # pull with rebase - to provide a cleaner, linear, bisectable history.
  #
  # To integrate changes between branches, you can merge or rebase.
  #
  # When we use "git pull", git does a fetch then a merge.
  # If we’ve made changes locally and someone else has pushed changes
  # to our git host then git will automatically merge these together
  # and create a merge commit that looks like this in the history:
  #
  #    12345678 - Merge branch 'foo' of bar into master
  #
  # When we use "git pull --rebase", git does a fetch then a rebase.
  # A rebase resets the HEAD of your local branch to be the same as
  # the remote HEAD, then replays your local commits back into repo.
  # This means you don’t get any noisy merge messages in your history.
  # This gives us a linear history, and also helps with git bisect.
  #
  # To automatically do "pull --rebase" for any branch based on master:
  #
  #    git config branch.master.rebase true
  #
  # To automatically do "pull --rebase" for all branches:
  #
  #     git config --global branch.autosetuprebase always
  #
  pr = pull --rebase

  ### rebase ###

  # rebase - forward-port local commits to the updated upstream head.
  rb = rebase

  # rebase - continue the rebasing process after resolving a conflict manually and updating the index with the resolution.
  rbc = rebase --continue

  # rebase - restart the rebasing process by skipping the current patch.
  rbs = rebase --skip

  # rbi - rebase interactive on our unpushed commits.
  #
  # Before we push our local changes, we may want to do some cleanup,
  # to improve our commit messages or squash related commits together.
  #
  # Let’s say I’ve pushed two commits that are related to a new feature and
  # I have another where I made a spelling mistake in the commit message.
  # When I run "git rbi" I get dropped into my editor with this:
  #
  #     pick 7f06d36 foo
  #     pick ad544d0 goo
  #     pick de3083a hoo
  #
  # Let's say I want to squash the "foo" and "goo" commits together,
  # and also change "hoo" to say "whatever". To do these, I change "pick"
  # to say "s" for squash; this tells git to squash the two together;
  # I also edit "hoo". I make the file look like:
  #
  #     pick 7f06d36 foo
  #     s ad544d0 goo
  #     r de3083a whatever
  # This gives me two new commit messages to edit, which I update.
  # Now when I push the remote repo host receives two commits
  #
  #     3400455 - foo
  #     5dae0a0 - whatever
  #
  rbi = !"git rebase -i @{u}"

  ### reflog ###

  # reflog - reference log that manages when tips of branches are updated.
  rl = reflog

  ### remote ###

  # remote - manage set of tracked repositories [same as "r"].
  rr = remote

  # remote show - gives some information about the remote <name>.
  rrs = remote show

  # remote update - fetch updates for a named set of remotes in the repository as defined by remotes.
  rru = remote update

  # remote prune - deletes all stale remote-tracking branches under <name>.
  rrp = remote prune

  ### revert ###

  # revert - undo the changes from some existing commits
  rv = revert

  # revert without autocommit; useful when you're reverting more than one commits' effect to your index in a row.
  rvnc = revert --no-commit

  ### show-branch ###

  # show-branch - print a list of branches and their commits.
  sb = show-branch

  ### submodule ###

  # submodule - enables foreign repositories to be embedded within a dedicated subdirectory of the source tree.
  sm = submodule

  # submodule update
  smu = submodule update

  # submodule update with initialize
  smui = submodule update --init

  # submodule update with initialize and recursive; this is useful to bring a submodule fully up to date.
  smuir = submodule update --init --recursive

  ### status ###

  # status with short format instead of full details
  ss = status --short

  # status with short format and showing branch and tracking info.
  ssb = status --short --branch

  # churn: show log of files that have many changes

  #   * Written by (Corey Haines)[http://coreyhaines.com/]
  #   * Scriptified by Gary Bernhardt
  #   * Obtained from https://github.com/garybernhardt/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/git-churn
  #   * Edited for sixarm_git_config repo by Joel Parker Henderson
  #   * Comments by Mislav http://mislav.uniqpath.com/2014/02/hidden-documentation/
  #
  # Show churn for whole repo:
  #
  #   $ git churn
  #
  # Show churn for specific directories:
  #
  #   $ git churn app lib
  #
  # Show churn for a time range:
  #
  #   $ git churn --since='1 month ago'
  #
  # These are all standard arguments to `git log`.
  #
  # It’s possible to get valuable insight from history of a project not only
  # by viewing individual commits, but by analyzing sets of changes as a whole.
  # For instance, git-log-churn compiles stats about which files change the most.
  #
  # For example, to see where work on an app was focused on in the past month:
  #
  #     $ git churn --since='1 month ago' app/ | tail
  #
  # This can also highlight potential problems with technical debt in a project.
  # A specific file changing too often is generally a red flag, since it probably
  # means the file either needed to be frequently fixed for bugs, or the file
  # holds too much responsibility and should be split into smaller units.
  #
  # Similar methods of history analysis can be employed to see which people were
  # responsible recently for development of a certain part of the codebase.
  #
  # For instance, to see who contributed most to the API part of an application:
  #
  #    $ git log --format='%an' --since='1 month ago' app/controllers/api/ | \
  #      sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head
  #
  #    109 Alice Anderson
  #    13 Bob Brown
  #    7 Carol Clark
  #

  ### MAINTENANCE ALIASES ###

  # pruner: prune everything that is unreachable now.
  #
  # This command takes a long time to run, perhaps even overnight.
  #
  # This is useful for removing unreachable objects from all places.
  #
  # By [CodeGnome](http://www.codegnome.com/)
  #
  pruner = !"git prune --expire=now; git reflog expire --expire-unreachable=now --rewrite --all"

  # repacker: repack a repo the way Linus recommends.
  #
  # This command takes a long time to run, perhaps even overnight.
  #
  # It does the equivalent of "git gc --aggressive"
  # but done *properly*,  which is to do something like:
  #
  #     git repack -a -d --depth=250 --window=250
  #
  # The depth setting is about how deep the delta chains can be;
  # make them longer for old history - it's worth the space overhead.
  #
  # The window setting is about how big an object window we want
  # each delta candidate to scan.
  #
  # And here, you might well want to add the "-f" flag (which is
  # the "drop all old deltas", since you now are actually trying
  # to make sure that this one actually finds good candidates.
  #
  # And then it's going to take forever and a day (ie a "do it overnight"
  # thing). But the end result is that everybody downstream from that
  # repository will get much better packs, without having to spend any effort
  # on it themselves.
  #
  # http://metalinguist.wordpress.com/2007/12/06/the-woes-of-git-gc-aggressive-and-how-git-deltas-work/

  # We also add the --window-memory limit of 1 gig, which helps protect
  # us from a window that has very large objects such as binary blobs.
  #
  repacker = !git repack -a -d -f --depth=300 --window=300 --window-memory=1g

  # Do everything we can to optimize the repository.
  #
  # This command takes a long time to run, perhaps even overnight.
  #
  # Currently, this command simply calls `git pruner` and `git repacker`.
  # There's a step that may be unnecessarying, calling `git prune-pack`.

  # Git aliases suitable for topic branches.
  #
  # These aliases are simple starting points for a simple topic flow.
  # Lots of people have lots of ideas about how to do various git flows.
  #
  # Some people like to use a topic branch for a new feature, or a
  # hotfix patch, or refactoring work, or some spike research, etc.
  # Adjust these as you like, to suit your project and/or team.

  # Start a topic branch.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #     git topic-start hello
  #
  # This implementatation does these steps:
  #
  #   1. Update the master branch
  #   2. Create a new branch with your topic name and based on the master branch
  #
  # Customize this for your own workflow preferences.
  #
  # If you use any kind of testing framework, or test driven development,
  # then it can be wise to test your topic immediately after running this,
  # to ensure that your branch starts with all the tests succeeding.
  ##

  topic-start = "!f(){ branch=$1; git checkout master; git fetch; git rebase; git checkout -b "$branch" master; };f"

  ##
  # Update the current topic branch by pulling changes.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #     git topic-pull
  #
  # This implementatation does these:
  #
  #   1. Update the master branch
  #   2. Update the topic branch with any changes from the master branch
  #
  # Customize this for your own workflow preferences.
  #
  # If you use any kind of testing framework, or test driven development,
  # then it can be wise to test your topic immediately after running this,
  # to ensure that any available updates are successfully integrated.
  ##

  topic-pull = "!f(){ branch=$(git branch-name); git checkout master; git pull; git checkout "$branch"; git rebase master; };f"

  ##
  # Update the current topic branch by pushing changes.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #     git topic-push
  #
  # This implementatation does these:
  #
  #   1. Push the topic branch to the origin.
  #   2. Set the upstream tracking.
  #
  # Customize this for your own workflow preferences.
  #
  # If you use a sharing site such a GitHub, and use typical settings,
  # then this implementation makes your branch visible to collaborators.
  #
  # Many teams share branches before they are fully ready, to help
  # the team provide feedback on the work-in-progress.
  ##

  topic-push = "!f(){ branch=$(git branch-name); git push -u origin "$branch"; };f"

  ##
  # Finish the current topic branch.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #     git topic-finish
  #
  # This implementatation does these:
  #
  #   1. Delete the topic branch locally.
  #   2. Delete the topic branch remotely.
  #
  # Customize this for your own workflow preferences.
  #
  # If you use a sharing site such a GitHub, and use typical settings,
  # then this implementation deletes your branch for the site.
  #
  # Many teams choose to delete topic branches when they are finished,
  # to keep the repositories clean and with a smaller number of branches.
  #
  # If git says "unable to push to unqualified destination" then it means
  # that the remote branch doesn't exist, so git is unable to delete it.
  # That's fine; it means someone else has already deleted the branch.
  # To synchronize your branch list, use "git fetch --prune".
  ##

  topic-finish = "!f(){ branch=$(git branch-name); git checkout master; git branch -d "$branch"; git push origin ":$branch"; };f"

  ### CVS ALIAS ###

  cvs-i = cvsimport -k -a
  cvs-e = cvsexportcommit -u -p

  ### GitK ###

  # show conflicting merge in gitk:
  gitk-conflict = !gitk --left-right HEAD...MERGE_HEAD

  # show full history in gitk (including "deleted" branches and stashes)
  gitk-history-all = !gitk --all $( git fsck | awk '/dangling commit/ {print $3}' )

  ### Ruby on Rails ###

  # Do everything we can to synchronize all changes for a Ruby On Rails app.
  # We like using rebase (instead of merge), bundle for gems, and rake db:migrate
  rails-get = !"git pull --rebase; git submodule update --init --recursive; bundle check || bundle install; bundle exec rake db:migrate; bundle exec rake db:test:prepare"

  ### Subversion ###

  svn-b = svn branch
  svn-m = merge --squash
  svn-c = svn dcommit
  svn-cp = !GIT_EDITOR='sed -i /^git-svn-id:/d' git cherry-pick -e
