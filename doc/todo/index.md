# To do list

To do list in priority order:

  * Create an alias that helps remove problem files, akin to `bfg`.

  * Create installable packages such as for `apt`, `brew`, `dnf`.

  * Create completion file for `bash`, `zsh`, etc.

  * Create CI/CD pipeline.

  * Create security checksum.

  * Create announcement list.

  * Request comments from git thought leaders.

  * Create aliases for GitPrime metrics suggestions: unreviewed pull requests, new work percentage, legacy refactor percentage, active days, time to first comment, churn, time to resolve.
