# Introduction


## What is Git Alias?

Git Alias is a collection of git version control shortcuts, functions, and commands:

  * Shortcuts such as `s` for `status`.

  * Improvements such as `optimize` to do a prune and repack with recommended settings.

  * Workflows such as `topic-begin` to create a new topic branch for a new feature.

  * Visualizations such as `graphviz` to show logs and charts using third-party tools.

### Why use this?

We are creating this alias list because we type these commands many times daily, and we want the commands to be fast and also accurate.

We often work on teams, across many companies and organizations, and using multiple shells. We want to count on a set of aliases. For shorter commands, such as `s` for `status`, fast speed is nice. For longer commands, such as `repacker`, accurate settings are important.
